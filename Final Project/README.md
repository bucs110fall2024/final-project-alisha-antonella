## Project Description
The concept for our game is a pizza cooking game in which the user is in charge of taking orders, preparing the pizza, and budgeting with the money that they make in order to continue buying supplies as they run out. The objective is to keep the restaurant open for as long as possible by correctly preparing orders and if they run out of budget/supplies the game will end.
